software samtools used for sort bam file of notification 
samtools sort in.bam out.sorted.bam  
comments:it head tag had no altered,using samtools view -H  out.sorted.bam to check the header tag displaying still unsort, 
when commands above completed. the problem was bug along with samtools sort command, which the tag still unsorted, however files bam had already sorted.
As the header you want to change, the picard of java sort like SortSam.jar subprogram(subroutine) should be token.
Usage:
$java -jar /share/nas2/genome/biosoft/picard-tools/current/SortSam.jar I=../FO.sam O=newsorted.bam SORT_ORDER=coordinate

comments:SORT_ORDER=coordinate tip the sort bam header tranfer header tag of unsorted into coordinate 
java -jar  genome/biosoft/picard-tools/1.94/AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar I=/FO_bam/scripts/sort1.bam.bam O=FO_bam/scripts/sort1.bam.bam.sorted.bam SO=coordinate RGID=sort1.bam RGLB=library RGPL=ILLUMINA RGPU=machine RGSM=sort1.bam
