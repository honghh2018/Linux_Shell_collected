if your dir have many files,you should take key word,for instance '*L309*' to find it.
ll Result/ *L309* 
and you want to transport your file on many file dir,just use above method.
for example:
scp -r "*L306*" honghh@192.168.8.8:/home/hui/data  #this command will choose the file including sting "L306" file to transport.
if you have good idea for this,you can do yourself.
