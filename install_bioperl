Bioperl module in which its packages comprise Bio::Seq and Bio::SeqIO was tremendously exquisit to cope with bioinformation in linux system.
Bioperl was designed for perl language to analyize bioinfo that consist of sort of bio-packages,as Bio::Seq and Bio::SeqIO,in addtions, those
 regularly was used, when it have me conduct the information of biology from now on.
 first of all, perl in web is going to install at you computer with the manual. besides, command line using perl -MCPAN -e shell get into
 perl module interface where you type string 'install Bio::Seq' or 'Bio::SeqIO' to setup one.until all mission above function, perl 
 scripts since were going to take those module for your jobs.
 In other aspects, the example fellow below:
 #!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use warnings;
use Bio::Seq;
use Bio::SeqIO;

my $input=shift;


my $count=10;
my $seqio=Bio::SeqIO->new('-format'=>'fasta',-file=>"$input");
#my $seqobj=Bio::Seq->new(-display_id=>)
while(my $seq=$seqio->next_seq()){
        my  $gene_id=$seq->display_id;
        #print $gene_id,"\n";
        my $seq_string=$seq->seq();
        my $tran=$seq->translate(); #invoking translate function 
        my $protein=$tran->seq;
        print $seq_string,"->\n",$protein,"\n";

        #my $seq_string=$seq->seq;
        #my $seq_string=$seq->subseq(10,50); #slice the string arrange from 10 to 50
        #print $seq_string,"\n";
        $count--;
        my $seqobj=Bio::Seq->new('-display_id'=>$gene_id,-seq =>$seq_string);
        my @traits=$seqobj->get_SeqFeatures();
        foreach my $traits(@traits){
                print "Feature:",$traits->primary_tag()," start",$traits->start," end";
                print $traits->end()," strand ",$traits->strand,"\n";
                print "Feature sequence is ",$traits->seq->seq(),"\n";

        }
        $count--;
        if($count<1){
                exit;
        }


}
