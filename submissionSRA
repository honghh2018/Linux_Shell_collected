Need fastq clean data for read, and NCBI will turn the fastq into SRA
you need to name the number of fastq. the below command should be used.
Preprocessing:
$ll data_gz/ |awk '{print $9}' | sed s/_J414-01//g |sed s/_good//g|sed s/.gz//g >file or STDOUT
//you should copy this line into NCBI's form named "samplename".
comments:
The sra submission including second generation or third generation of data, the format in excel have the chioce of drop-down menu,which 
you can select the HD5 format.
The fastq just choose fastq format token.

The three generation submission need four file with .bas and three bax data.
