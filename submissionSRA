Need fastq clean data for read, and NCBI will turn the fastq into SRA
you need to name the number of fastq. the below command should be used.
Preprocessing:
$ll data_gz/ |awk '{print $9}' | sed s/_J414-01//g |sed s/_good//g|sed s/.gz//g >file or STDOUT
//you should copy this line into NCBI's form named "samplename".
comments:
The sra submission including second generation or third generation of data, the format in excel have the chioce of drop-down menu,which 
you can select the HD5 format.
The fastq just choose fastq format.

The three generation submission need four files with .bas and three bax data, which fill in the SRAmetadata.xlsx left 4 columns and the title name 
with the prefix of .bax.
